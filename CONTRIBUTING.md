# Contributing RFCs

Please ensure you've read and understand [the RFC process](readme.md). RFCs which do not comply with this process may be swiftly closed.

By contributing RFCs to this repository, you agree to license all text, code, and other contributions under the [GNU General Public License, v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html) or later.

Changes to this repo must go through pull requests, except for:

* Numbering RFC documents after merge (e.g. `0000-new-feature.md` to `3124-new-feature.md`)
* Adding the Trac issue URL for an RFC

Amendments or fixes to existing RFCs that do not change the meaning of an RFC should be submitted as pull requests with the Amendment label. Changes to the meta documents (this contribution guide, and the readme) should be submitted as pull requests with the Meta label (changes to this documents that substantially change the RFC process must themselves go through the RFC process, except as at the discretion of the core team).
